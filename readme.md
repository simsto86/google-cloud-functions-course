### Starting a project
To start a new project in Google Cloud, go to the 
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) or create it from [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) 

## Creating a virtual environment
First we have to install 'python3-venv' with the following command: ```sudo apt install python3-venv ```
Then, we execute the following command:
``python -m venv venv``
To activate the virtual environment we do:
``source venv/bin/activate``
or ``.\venv\Scripts\Activate`` in Windows/powershell
In order to add new packages to our new virtual environment we create a file called `requirements.txt` and execute the following command: 
``pip install -r reqirements.txt``
